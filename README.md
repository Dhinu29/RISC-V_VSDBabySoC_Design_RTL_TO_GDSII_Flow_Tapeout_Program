# 🧠 RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program — Weekly Reports

This document contains all my weekly project reports for the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** (10-week open-source VLSI design training).  
All work was done using open-source tools — Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Ngspice, Yosys, OpenSTA, and OpenLane with the Sky130 PDK.
